<p>We had already discussed that the during IBM PC time the main two <strong>non-volatile</strong> memory storage devices were Hard drives and Floppy disks, which turn out to have similar structure.</p>
<p>So it would be useful to discuss the physical structure of the hard drives first.</p>
<h2 id="physical-structure">
  Physical structure
  <a class="anchor" href="#physical-structure">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The disk consists of basic addressable units &ndash; <strong>sectors</strong>. One can not read or write less than a sector direcrly off of a disk.</p>
<p><img src="/images/hard_drive.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Group of sectors located at the same radius from the origin are organized into <strong>tracks</strong>. The tracks have circular shape. Group of tracks that spans along multiple heads is called <strong>cylinder</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="chs-addressing">
  CHS Addressing
  <a class="anchor" href="#chs-addressing">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Early hard drives did not have an embedded <strong>controller</strong>, that could do address transformations. You could not say &ldquo;give me 128th sector&rdquo;. Instead, you had to specify the location of a sector with accordance to its physical structure &ndash; giving the number of the sector, intex of the head and the cylinder.</p>
<p>This is what CHS (Cylinder-Head-Sector) addressing is. Address of a sector is specified with a tuple of three numbers (C/H/S). The numbering of sectors starts from one, so the sector number can not be zero. Cylinder and Head are zero-based.</p>
<p>BIOSes use 8 bytes for head, 10 bytes for cylinder and 6 bytes for the sector. The whole data fits in 3 bytes:</p>
<pre><code>CCCCCCCC CCSSSSSS HHHHHHHH
</code></pre><p>Where C specifies a cylinder bit, S specifies a sector bit, and H specifies a head bit.</p>
<p>And since the addressing information was limited by these three bytes, there were limits for each of the measurements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sector: <code>1..63</code></li>
<li>Cylinder: <code>0..1023</code></li>
<li>Head: <code>0..255</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Although the actual limit was 255, there was a bug in IBM PC BIOS, that would crash if it saw a drive with 255 heads. Therefore the actual limit for the heads index was 254.</p>
<p>So CHS addressing supported a drive with at most 63 sectors per track, 1024 tracks per head and 255 heads. Given the sector is 512 bytes, the limit for the CHS addressing is:</p>
<pre><code>512*63*1024*255 = 8422686720 bytes = 8032.5 Mb
</code></pre><p>About 8 Gb. That is way too little to support modern hard drives and USB flashes. And since some devices had a different geometry, e.g. different number of tracks per second, the actual limit is <em>even less</em>.</p>
<p>IBM PC only supported floppy disk storage. So it makes sense why the 8 Gb limit was fine. (Hard disk storage was introduced with IBM PC/XT)</p>
<p>Sometimes to get around that some devices had embedded a <strong>controller</strong> that would lie to BIOS about device&rsquo;s geometry. And when BIOS was talking to the device, the controller would implicitly convert the &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; CHS address that BIOS gave it into the &ldquo;real&rdquo; one that was matching the device&rsquo;s geometry.</p>
<p>So for modern hard disks CHS address no longer correspond to the physical layout of the drive.</p>
<h2 id="lba-addressing">
  LBA addressing
  <a class="anchor" href="#lba-addressing">#</a>
</h2>
<p>To further overcome the 8 Gb limit of CHS addressing IBM introduced <strong>BIOS Enhanced Disk Drive Services</strong>, that introduced a new 64-bit addressation of the sectors on the disk.</p>
<p>The LBA address was a single 64-bit number corresponding to the zero-based index of the sector. This is pretty straightforward. With this the limit was raised until <code>8589934592 Tb</code>. That&rsquo;s pretty much infinite.</p>
<p>However by ATA-6 specification only 48 bits are used. So the actual limit is <code>131072 Tb</code>.</p>
