<p>Before we dive into inspecting various components that participate in boot-time function of the OS, I would like to make a special overview of the history of PCs. This will make the understanding of BIOS as well as other &ldquo;features&rdquo; of the booting process much easier.</p>
<p>The term PC was due to one mainstream computer from IBM called the <strong>IBM PC</strong>. Nowadays the term &ldquo;PC&rdquo; most of the time refers to an x86 computer capable of running Windows, Linux. PC can be contrasted to another term &ndash; &ldquo;Mac&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="1-ibm-pc">
  1. IBM PC
  <a class="anchor" href="#1-ibm-pc">#</a>
</h2>
<p>IBM PC was using the <strong>Intel 8088</strong> processor, which is a cost-reduced variant of <strong>Intel 8086</strong> processor.</p>
<p>Intel 8086 was a 16-bit processor, which could store numbers up to <code>FFFFh</code> (65535). The address bus was <strong>20 bits</strong>, which meant processor could address up to <strong>1 Mb</strong> of memory.</p>
<p>The first <strong>640 Kb</strong> of the 1 Mb address space was given to OS and user programs, the other <strong>384 Kb</strong> were dedicated to video memory, and the motherboard ROM.</p>
<p>The main storage media at the time were the <strong>floppy drives</strong> and <strong>hard drives</strong>. Their physical structure was similar. Each one of them was split into 512-byte sectors. It is only possible to read or write the whole sector at once (no single-byte writes). The difference between floppies and hard drives is that floppies were used as portable media just like USB flash is used now.</p>
<p>BIOS in IBM PCs was the hardware abstraction layer that allowed OSes to perform hardware input/output functions independently of the actual hardware used in the system.</p>
<h2 id="2-ibm-pc-compatibles">
  2. IBM PC Compatibles
  <a class="anchor" href="#2-ibm-pc-compatibles">#</a>
</h2>
<p>It was desirable for many companies to produce and sell similar and compatible to IBM PC computers. Those computers are called <strong>IBM PC Compatibles</strong>. Nowadays all PCs that run windows are PC Compatible.</p>
<p>Companies that sold IBM PC at the time reverse-engeneered IBM PC. Later some parts were standartised, and other remained de-facto standard. Those computers use the same address bus and BIOS with similar API.</p>
<p>Though many of those systems weren&rsquo;t fully compatible. It could be that some PC Compatibles were implementing extra functionality, or underimplementing some functionality. Some functionality could be implemented with bugs et cetera.</p>
<h2 id="3-now">
  3. Now
  <a class="anchor" href="#3-now">#</a>
</h2>
<p>PCs have evolved, some parts of the original IBM PC were standartised and/or replaced (about that later). To this day many computers support legacy interfaces for backwards compatibility reasons.</p>
<p>The Intel CPUs have evolved. 8086 had evolved into 80186, then into 80286 and then into 80386. The names of the processors all ended in &ldquo;86&rdquo;, so collectively they make the <strong>x86</strong> processor architecture.</p>
<p>It was desirable for Intel to keep the backwards compatibility within their processors, so that newer processor could be able to work with older software. That&rsquo;s why even new 64-bit Intel processors start up in so-called <strong>real mode</strong>, a special 16-bit mode that uses 20-bit address bus.</p>
<p>Backwards compatibility is one of the main reasons why learning about booting process feels like visiting an old computers museum :)</p>
